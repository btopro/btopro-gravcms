<p>I remember in high school talking about biology and as a test, you have to poke your arm with a small pin (lightly) and report when you can tell the difference between where it is and where your brain is telling you &quot;Hey that&#39;s in a new place&quot;. The point was to demonstrate that our nerve endings are only so far apart and as a result only so capable of measuring change.</p><p>Has the same effect starting occurring to us all?</p><p>Have we lost the ability to detect the change in our history currently taking place. Is the saturation of information and data points due to 24/7 news, twitter&#39;s instantaneous results, devices on everywhere at all times, radio, billboards, blog posts and magazines. Have we come to a point where there is so much data we are simply filtering it all our, no longer having enough time to dig deep enough to evaluate the truthfulness of the statements?</p><p>When you have people lying to your face on TV and others refuting their claims, their recourse is often boiled down to &quot;google ____ you&#39;ll see&quot;. Will you see? Will you take the time to verify claims or counter claims? Or do you do what too many do (myself included); look for the likes, hearts and retweets and use social validation as a sign of confirming correctness. Isn&#39;t that what all the others pushing that RT button did? Assume; assume with all the information they are getting bombarded with that their 20 seconds to read a tweet, process it, laugh and/or get angry and decide to RT... was this really enough to ingest, process, explore and assess?</p><p>Has technology eliminated our ability to do the hard work of looking.</p><p>It is not to blame the media, or blame the technology platforms; but it is to blame the self. Without self control, self moderation as to how much data we consume and expose ourselves to that we&#39;re losing what it is to be human. We&#39;re losing the desire to process, to go beyond simply reacting but to really, genuinely question, process, and respond (or even better, NOT respond).</p><p>Is there too much noise to really have things like facts matter? Are fact just what a large enough group of people say and feel? With access to so many so easily, it&#39;s easy to make the faulty assumption that quantity of agreement equates to quality of information.</p><p>We are a culture drunk on data, and as a result, we&#39;re not paying attention to what any of it means. Be careful who you aggregate.</p>
