title: 'Told, Asked, Capable, Challenged.'
---

## Told
What are you told to do? Do you do what you're told? Do you *only* do what you're told? How does it make you feel when someone tells you what to do as opposed to asks your opinion?

## Asked
What is it like when you are asked to explore? Asked your opinion? Asked for your input on a critical decision? How much more impactful is it to be asked to participate in something rather then told to do something?

## Capable
What are you capable of? What is asked or told of you that really is way below what your capable of? What could you be doing? Where could you go and where could you take your organization if you were being used to the fullest of your capability?

## Challenged
Where could you go if you lived up to your capability and then began being challenged? What is a challenge to you? What challenges you now and encourages you to do more? To be more? To want more, both for yourself and your organization,
