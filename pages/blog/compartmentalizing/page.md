title: Compartmentalizing
---




<p><div>bitter sweet. 15 minutes spent creating things out of previous lego sets with my son made the entire day. I couldn't sleep tonight, so instead of a beer I had a ginger ale and thought about what I loved from the day. those 15 minutes stood out by a long shot.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll probably never remember today, or maybe I will in writing this into a blog after it's posted here. But it's the day I hopefully saved myself just a little bit through compartmentalization. I tore down my home whiteboard and giant elms sticker.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>These tools of boundless creativity don't belong in my basement, surrounded by lego stickers, playsets, imagination.. creativity. These are the tools my boys use. I need to get back to them and foster their creativity because none of the rest of it really matters in the end.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All is right in the basement now. Legos out, reminders of work hidden (or thrown) away. Just a mess of creativity that can unlock unknown adventures at the flip of a neuron in their imaginative little heads. What wonders they'll teach me; they always do.</div>
