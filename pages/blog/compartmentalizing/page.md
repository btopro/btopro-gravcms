title: Compartmentalizing
---



<p>bitter sweet. 15 minutes spent creating things out of previous lego sets with my son made the entire day. I couldn't sleep tonight, so instead of a beer I had a ginger ale and thought about what I loved from the day. those 15 minutes stood out by a long shot.Â I'll probably never remember today, or maybe I will in writing this into a blog after it's posted here. But it's the day I hopefully saved myself just a little bit through compartmentalization. I tore down my home whiteboard and giant elms sticker.</p>
