<p>I saw this picture at Disney's Test Track ride and had to take a picture. I love that the build up to this ride they have lots of (propaganda) pictures, prototypes and interviews with people about cars. What cars mean to them, what they represent in American culture, what they're experiences were with cars and why these designers got passionate about creating designs for new cars.</p>
<p>While this is what Disney does to pass the time while waiting in a multiple hour line, this one stood out to me because while a Chevy commercial from start to finish, it was at least a cool and inspiring Chevy commercial. These four words had little descriptive signs to go with them early on in the ride (aka start of the line) which talked about the components to any new car or idea that they would come up with. I like these four concepts for building something new and wanted to bring them to our edTech world we build.</p>
<h2>Line</h2>
<p>Designers start with an idea.  We get an idea from anywhere, maybe something we saw we liked or something we're reacting to that we didn't. No matter what the idea though it starts with jotting it down. Taking notes, reflecting (with lots of coffee and music) about what we could build. Writing and drawing are the first phase to bringing something new into existence.</p>
<h2>Clay</h2>
<p>Then it's time to prototype the idea. We have to take it from sketches and, again with lots of coffee and music, bring that idea to reality on a screen. Maybe it's not the finished product, but it's enough of a sculpting of future reality that we can bring our vision to life in the eyes of someone attune to what we are expressing. The clay phase isn't finalized but it at least is semi-functional and allows us to get confirmation (or rejection) of the premise we're building against so that we can form it more fully later.</p>
<h2>Math</h2>
<p>Next after refinement as a block of clay it's time to take the idea and ensure it fits with the laws of physics. In edTech, our "laws of physics" is often constraints of delivering media on the web. Package size, dependencies on other existing things, extending our universe of tools to be as robust as possible without bloating it. Beyond this, our laws extend into actual laws like needing to account for accessibility and universal design.</p>
<h2>Emotion</h2>
<p>Passion for the car and what your building. We certainly align here and this word was really what lead me to want to write it down. If you don't have passion for what you're building, then you need to find some place that does bring you that satisfaction in life. We bring an undying passion to our work, knowing the creations we build are used to impact the minds of thousands. It's not easy designing future systems, especially not politically, but keeping in mind who we're here to serve makes it all worth it.</p>
<p>You can see emotion in what I write, I'm told it's visible in what I say in presentations too (though that's usually the coffee + coffee + music doing that). I've been told lately it's infectious and that's really good to hear; cause several years ago @btopro wasn't as well received or appreciated for enthusiasm.  When your outside the <a innertext="Overton window" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window" title="Overton window political theory" target="_blank">Overton window</a>
, people will reject what your saying. If you really do believe in what you're preaching, then it's on you not to try and change them (or you) but to change the way you message what you believe.</p>
<p>Simple language changes can trigger a reaction of "wow I see it that way now" instead of "what are you pushing now?". Don't give up. Organizations want to remain at rest unless acted upon by an unstoppable force. Be that force of change in whatever you aspire to do.</p>
