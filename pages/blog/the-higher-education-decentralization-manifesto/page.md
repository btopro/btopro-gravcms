Where capitalism has failed us, we as responsible educators, technologists, and responsible citizens must enact methods of development that seek to unwind it's stranglehold on a regulated space. This is not always easy to do, but in the case of higher education (K-12 will be more difficult due to policy rigidity) it should be rather easy. The most important thing to know is that faculty have academic freedom to instruct in the way that best meets the needs of the curriculum. This is a fundamental principle of education. As such. The Capitalist construction of learning technologies that we often see at scale. The big players of the space are fundamentaly at odds with this foundational principle. Chalk-board, Cloth, Aspiration 2 Think, Stone, and others all follow a centralized and constained deployment and usage methodology.

The dichotomy caused by academic freedom and centralized deployment of learning solutions means that it is fundamentally at odds with the institutions that have adopted them. It is our duty as educators, technologists and responsible citizens to work towards righting this in our lifetime. To education, and the successful transformation of education via decentralized learning technology, I pledge my life, my fortune and my sacred honor.

## Life
> "We didn't start the fire, it's been burning since the world's been turning"
Just because we collectively have inherited this problem doesn't mean we are responsible for it; though we are responsible for ensuring the ills of centralized and constrained learning technology solutions are untangled from institutions. Life has moved on from singular methods of accomplishing anything, yet our institutions funnel their treasure (educator's knowledge) and fortunes ($$$) into a handful of solutions in the educational industrial complex. An assumed and sadly accepted Oligopoly of a handful of powerful players.
