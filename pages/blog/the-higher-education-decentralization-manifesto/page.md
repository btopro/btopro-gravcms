# The Knowledge Decentralization Manifesto

Knowledge and its access is a system of control. As the "[Apple of Eden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_fruit)" unlocked the power to question so too is the case with all modern knowledge transfer technologies. Knowledge corrupts established thought, expands horizons, and changes human outcomes in powerful ways. It has network effects of its own and so, it is imperative that we as producers and orchestrators of knowledge production, management and dissemination acknowledge the power we wield. We have the power to shape society. So how best can we utilize our tallents to maximize empowerment?

_It is an ethical imperative that we seek the fundamental transformation of higher education to maximize quality and access to knowledge_. This transformation will empower the globe to increase empathy, maximize personal freedom and personal growth through increased educational equality.

## Change knowledge dissemination; change everything.

We will build a more open, more accessible, more equal opportunities, and as a result a more just society through the empowerment of all regardless of background, experience, status or financial means. What structural problems must we attack in order to fundamentally alter the dissemination and production of knowledge? What philosophy of system design can we adopt in order to change structural inequality?

[Actor network theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor%E2%80%93network_theory) offers a critical lens with which to view production and implementation of knowledge dissemination technologies. TLDR; all machines and human connections influence one another equally and their relative positioning to one another is important. Simply using a tool is not enough, the tool must provide affordances that eliminate structural inequality in knowledge production and dissemination.

To illustrate that there is a difference in possibilities through knowledge dissemination usage:

![A, B contrasting knowledge dissemination and learning environment management](avsb%20information%20construction.jpeg)

All knowledge is produced by accessing website X. All knowledge seekers access website X.
A counter to this approach is similar in initial access but maximizes flexibility and potential quality of experience
All knowledge is produced in any location that best meets its needs (Solution Y), then referenced in website X. All knowledge seekers access website X, but are pushed out to website Y.

## Decentralization of knowledge construction
This decentralization of knowledge construction still affords the minimal amount of centralization required to avoid chaos, which I shall deem [structured anarchy](https://btopro.wordpress.com/2011/03/21/structured-anarchy/). The point of decentralizing knowledge production is not to produce chaos, it is to provide more vibrant, local options to better meet the needs of knowledge producers based on the topic of choice. We don't setup science lab classes expecting to teach forestry in them. We don't expect our doctors of tomorrow to learn while dangling from a tree harness.

> Why then should it be obsurd to construction technology environments that best meet the needs of the topic at hand?

Seeding this ground, that all learning environments and knowledge production silos are the same, forces us to accept structural failings of today's learning management systems which better resemble a theocracy then today's vibrant internet culture. These structural failures lead to simple technical ones that are difficult for modern knowledge produces to understand (yet are forced to accept):

![A typical cycle produced by lack of empowerment](the%20last%2030%20years%20of%20knowledge%20dissemination_.jpeg)

- Want to improve engagement with learners and knowledge seekers? No, the theocracy doesn't allow JavaScript.
- Want to improve perception of knowledge quality through design? No, the theocracy demands understanding of complex technical underpinnings.
- Want to reference or pull in external knowledge? Yes, but only if it follows our ridged, dated orthodoxies of API design.

## There's another way out.

A phrase has emerged (circa 2014) to attempt to encompass the antithesis of the theocratic knowledge production market. [Next Generation Digital Learning Environments (NGDLE)](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2014/9/next-generation-digital-learning-environment-initiative) is thought of as the response to legacy theocratic knowledge dissemination technologies. NGDLE embraces knowledge construction by leveraging a free and open internet as well as the construction of new learning ecosystems. It seeks maximal freedom for knowledge producers to utilize whatever methods of production they can access in order to best disseminate knowledge to those seeking it.

The theocratic knowledge production market has attempted to utilize existing methods of structural inequality in order to perpetuate their control in the name of next generation. It utilizes legacy standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) in order to claim that it has embraced the internet by providing a window out to it.

![Theocratic knowledge production market where it really is, where it claims, and then where NGDLE and my projects attempt to take society](innovation%20in%20course%20infrastructure.jpg)

"Look at us, we've changed. No really, we have. We *allow you* to access (some) additional methods of construction. Just stay with us, please, we've changed." the theocratic knowledge production market says. Like an abusive lover though, it hasn't actually changed, it's just gotten a haircut and bought flowers (or, you know, adopted Twitter's bootstrap framework and claimed the high ground of usability as a result).

The knowledge production theocracy wants you; needs you; no, demands that you stay in a stasis.

## No.

NGDLE is not about building up a long dead, one sided relationship (and ideology). It's an approach that says we need to tell the LMS that "we're cool, we've moved on. We can still be friends though". I mean, LMS still has all your CDs in it's car and you can't just leave 40 or 50 CDs in LMS's car right? No, don't abandon your CDs in LMS's car; I'm saying thought that we need to consider how we can make LMS useful the best self it can be too. The LMS was never meant to do too much, but we previously demanded that it do so. Like every Disney villan, they aren't purely evil, the theocratic knowledge production market is just misguided. It's going where capitalism has allowed it to go and needs a purely decentralized, internet mindset in order to right the (sinking) ship.

NGDLE more then technology construction is about aligning the foundational principle of academic freedom with technology freedom. While the theocratic knowledge production market provides and enforces bland experience construction; NGDLE by contrast fosters personal growth, seeking new idea and expanding horizons through the intentional decentralization of knowledge production and dissemination.

This is why NGDLE has been so difficult for anyone to embrace. NGDLE is not a product. It is a mindset, a method of knowledge assembly that ensures no centralized authority can exist. Without centralization, it's very difficult for the theocratic knowledge production market (as it presently exists) to make money. And if it's purely profit driven (spoiler alert: they don't care about you no matter how big their conference, they want your money).

## Forcing the market to surcome to NGDLE

If the market existed, then capitalism alone would provide it right? We've been asking for these products and the theocratic knowledge production market provided. To which I'd retort... when Toys R Us existed and we all went to a centralized location to buy toys, did we sit around and think "huh, there's gotta be a way we can get rid of this process and provide better outcomes". I mean, the market produced a solution to a need, we utilized it, so it was clearly the best (I mean they had a run for 70+ years. That = correct).

Some will argue the market caught up with them (ala Amazon specifically) but what really happened? Amazon embraced a decentralized access methodology. They aligned with the structure of the internet and effectively collapsed traditional players in a space (sadly in their case, they will destroy the marketplace at scale but that's not for today). 

The knowledge production industrial complex will be systematically destroyed through the encouraging of knowledge producers to simply leave.

ELMS:LN is seeking to be that minimal structure necessary to ensure there is no anarchy but seeks that people empower themselves instead of being required to stand on our shoulders in order to succeed.
