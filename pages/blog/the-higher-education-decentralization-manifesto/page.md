# The Knowledge Decentralization Manifesto

Knowledge and its access is a system of control. As the apple of Eden unlocked the power to question so too is the case with all modern knowledge. Knowledge corrupts established thought, expands horizons, and ultimately changes human outcomes. It has network effects of its own. It is imperative that we as producers and orchestrators of knowledge production, management and dissemination acknowledge the power we wield.

It is an ethical imperative that we seek the fundamental transformation of higher education to broadly improve access to knowledge. This transformation seeks to empower a global audience to achieve maximal freedom through educational equity and personal growth.

Change knowledge dissemination; change everything.

We will build a more open, more accessible, more equal opportunity, and more just society through the empowerment of all regardless of background, experience, status or financial means.

## Attacking structural problems in technology
What structural problems must we attack in order to fundamentally alter the dissemination and production of knowledge? What philosophy of system design can we adopt in order to change structural inequality? Actor network theory offers a critical lens with which to view production and implementation of knowledge dissemination technologies. That is that all machines and people are connected and influence one another both in their interactions and their relative positioning to one another. Simply using a tool is not enough, the tool must provide affordances that eliminate structural inequality in knowledge production and dissemination.

To illustrate that there is a difference, consider this diagram.

All knowledge is produced by accessing website X. All knowledge seekers access website X.
A counter to this approach is similar in initial access but maximizes flexibility and potential quality of experience
All knowledge is produced in any location that best meets its needs (Solution Y), then referenced in website X. All knowledge seekers access website X, but are pushed out to website Y.


This decentralization of knowledge construction still affords the minimal amount of centralization required to avoid chaos. The point of decentralizing knowledge production is not to produce chaos, it is to provide more vibrant, local options to better meet the needs of knowledge producers based on the topic of choice. We don't setup science lab classes expecting to teach forestry in them and we don't expect our doctors of tomorrow to learn while dangling from a tree harness. Why then should it be obsurd to construction technology environments that best meet the needs of the topic at hand?

These corporations deploy technology well equipped for a theocracy, not today's liberated internet social fabric.

These structural failures lead to simple technical ones that are difficult for modern knowledge produces to understand:
- Want to improve engagement with learners and knowledge seekers? No, the theocracy doesn't allow JavaScript.
- Want to improve perception of knowledge quality through design? No, the theocracy demands understanding of complex technical underpinnings.
- Want to reference or pull in external knowledge? Yes, but only if it follows our ridged, dated orthodoxies of API design.

A phrase has emerged (circa 2015) to attempt to encompass the antithesis of the theocratic knowledge production methodology. Next Generation Digital Learning Environments (NGDLE) is thought of as the response to the historical theocratic knowledge dissemination technology; it see knowledge production embrace knowledge construction allowable by a free and open internet. It seeks maximal freedom for knowledge producers to utilize whatever methods of production they can access in order to best disseminate knowledge to those seeking it.

The theocracy though has attempted to utilize existing methods of structural inequality in order to perpetuate their control in the name of next generation. It utilizes legacy standards like Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI) in order to claim that it has embraced the internet.

"Look at us, we've changed. No really, we have. See, we *allow you* to access these additional methods of construction. Just stay with us, please, we've changed." the theocracy says. Like an abusive lover though, it hasn't actually changed, it's just gotten a haircut and bought flowers.

The knowledge production theocracy wants you, needs you, demands that you stay put. No. NGDLE is not about constant embrace of a dead relationship and ideology. NGDLE more then technology construction is about aligning the foundational principle of academic freedom with technology freedom. While the knowledge production orthodoxy DEMANDS compliance, control, centralized power, and bland legacy experience construction remain; NGDLE fosters personal growth and expanding of horizons through the intentional decentralization of knowledge production and dissemination.

This is why NGDLE has been so difficult for anyone to embrace. NGDLE is not a product. It is a mindset, a method of knowledge assembly that ensures no centralized authority can exist. The knowledge production industrial complex will be systematically destroyed through the encouraging of knowledge producers to simply leave.

ELMS:LN is seeking to be that minimal structure necessary to ensure there is no anarchy but seeks that people empower themselves instead of being required to stand on our shoulders in order to succeed.
