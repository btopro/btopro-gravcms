title: NGDL...Enigma
---

NGDLE might as well be another word for Enigma. I mean look at it. It's a bunch of letters thrown at the wall. It sounds awful, it's hard to pronounced or use in a sentance and still, people have difficulting saying what one is let alone showing it to you. We all have our own ideas of what we think NGDLE is, what it could be and where it could take us. But I'm not here to add another "what could it be". I'm going to bank the future of all of them on a few concepts and show you how we're building out under their banners. These are the important technology concepts that will make NGDLE less of a mess.

1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - An application containment and deployment system of packaging.
2. [Webcomponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/) - Browsers can understand developer defined tags like `<home-page-button>`
3. API Standards - [oAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) (beyond just LTI), REST, RPC, [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/)

### Excuse me, you said there would be pictures
Oh yes, my bad. These are highly complex topics each of their own. So let's make a pretty picture to start breaking down the technical barriers in those three things.
