NGDLE might as well be another word for Enigma.
I mean look at it. It's a bunch of letters thrown at the wall. It's hard to pronounced or use in a sentence and people still have difficulty saying what one is let alone showing it beyond pictures of legos or other childhood toys. We all have our own ideas of what we think NGDLE is, what it could be and where it could take us. At Penn State, we're building an NGDLE called ELMS: Learning Network. For those on the development team, comprised of multiple colleges and some outside collaborators, NGDLE stands for Next Generation Distributed Learning Ecosystem.

We feel it's important to emphasize that what we're all building is both a decentralized and ecosystem driven mindset. Solutions can and will come from anywhere (decentralized + centralize), so how can we best support this ecosystem of distributed tools? ELMS:LN is an attempt at becoming the lego-grid (so to speak) of NGDLE. No matter what bricks you plug into the grid plate, you'll always have need for the grid to keep it all together.

But how do we even get toward building? What does that look like? How's it working right now for those using it?

Let's look at a shipping container for comparison to educational technologies. All of the guts of that container don't matter to those in the shipping industry, they only care about it being the right size and shape with a door that opens in a consistent way.
Now, in edtech, what we'll care about in reaching toward NGDLE isn't that different. If each container is an educational experience or course, we don't care how different they are so long as they conform to certain standardards in "shipping" so to speak. For institutions, that's things like the syllabus. For technologists that's answering "Can I sustainably run and manage this system whether on premisis, in the cloud or vendor supported?". As NGDLE will encompass a mix of bought and built solutions playing nice, them conforming to certain design patterns is important.
